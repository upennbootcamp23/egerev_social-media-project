## Installation

The following packages have to be installed:
1. Node.js
2. Express
3. Mongoose

## Usage

The project is Node.js-based, so that means that the terminal has to be open. However, Postman also has to be open to test run the project.

Additionally, this project allows the user to see the thoughts, the reactions, and the users. 

## Credits

While I may have had some help from multiple sources (as listed below), I can assure you that the work provided is my own, original work.

1. While I had some help from my friend njthanhtrang, I used the files FOR INSPIRATION ONLY. All the variables, all the files, are MY OWN, ORIGINAL WORK.
